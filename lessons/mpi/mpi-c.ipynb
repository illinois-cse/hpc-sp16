This limits the usefulness of SIMD, but it is still a very powerful tool, particularly in linear algebra.\n",

The issue is that explicitly specifying a different set of instructions for each processor is generally tedious and cumbersome, especially if you want to try solving the same problem on a different number of processors. That's why most programming is done using **SPMD**, where a single program is written, but the program may (or may not) assign different instructions to each processor.

To do this correctly, we need to be able to distinguish which process we are providing instructions to and how many total processes need instructions.  We can do this by taking advantage of the environment we just discussed.  Every process is automatically assigned a rank in each of the communicators it belongs to.  We can use `MPI_Comm_rank` to determine that rank, and `MPI_Comm_size` to tell us the total number of processes in that communicator. The prototype for each function is below:\n",

As it turns out, this is a very common operation in distributed memory computing, and there is a specific MPI function to accomplish exactly this. We can render this program much more readable and less error-prone by using the convenience function `MPI_Reduce`, which achieves the same effective outcome as the prior code without the explicit message management.  Reduction takes a series of values from each processor, applies some operation to them, and then places the result on the root process (which doesn't have to be `0`, although it often is).

As you can imagine, this both slows down your code and makes even simple messaging schemes cumbersome (what happens if you tell every process to send at the same time and receive at the next function call?).  In order to prevent this kind of deadlock, we use _nonblocking_ communications, which do not block execution—they just fire their message into the ether and proceed ahead.\n",

The problem is that process 1 didn't wait to see if the message was actually received before it got to the print statement.  Since we used a nonblocking receive, MPI returned control to the program without ensuring validity of the receive buffer.  So process 1 had finished running through the program before the message was ever sent.\n",

    "What about the case where we have some unrelated work to do right after the receive?  We'd like to be able to perform this work while we wait for the message to arrive (overlapping computation and communication, an important concept in parallel programming), and since we're not using the same variable, we don't have to worry about accessing the buffer prematurely.  In fact, this is the true purpose of the nonblocking communications.  We can check whether the receive has completed after performing these unrelated calculations by using the MPI_Test or MPI_Wait functions.  Both of these functions use the `MPI_Request` argument to check the status of the nonblocking communication.  MPI_Test will provide a flag indicating whether the nonblocking command has finished or not, and MPI_Wait will prevent the process from continuing until the communication has completed.  Try it in this next example."

Weak scaling can be tested in a straightforward manner by keeping track of the pieces of the puzzle each process is responsible for.  With strongly decomposable systems, like molecular dynamics or PDE solution on meshes, weak scaling can be revealing.  However, in my experience there are many types of problems for which solving for $N$ and solving for $N+1$ are radically different problems, such as in density functional theory where the addition of an electron means the solution of a fundamentally different physical system."

    "Application memory is conventionally divided into two regions:  the _stack_ and the _heap_.  For many applications it doesn't really matter which you use, but when you start defining very large arrays of data or using multiple threads in parallel then it can become critical to manage your memory well. ([ref1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap)) ([ref2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22555639/mpi-communicate-large-two-dimensional-arrays))\n",

    "C99 variable-length arrays (VLAs) allocate on the stack.  Since you can overflow the stack, VLAs are probably not a good idea for serious numeric code.  They do make code so much more readable that I opted for them in this lesson.\n"

There are a couple options to tackle this problem, one way is to get the address to the first piece of data in the vector, `&vector[0]`.  This will work because the data in an std::vector is guaranteed to be continuous.  \n",
